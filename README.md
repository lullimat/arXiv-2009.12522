This project will be updated in order be kept functional for further updates to [**idea.deploy**](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy).

Welcome to the repository related to the paper published on [https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.063309](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.103.063309) and on arXiv [https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12522](https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.12522).
In order to use this repository you should have cloned it from the parent project [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) in the directory ./papers by means of the local python script idpy-papers.py.

In order to open the present Jupyter notebook "ShanChenPressureTensorIsotropy.ipynb" you should perform the following steps
- install the [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) project, following the instructions in the README.md in the section "Installation"
- load the idea.deploy python virtual environment: if you installed the bash aliases for the [idea.deploy](https://github.com/lullimat/idea.deploy) project you can issue the command "idpy-load"
- launch locally the Jupyter server with "idpy-jupyter"
- copy and paste in your browser the url prompted in the terminal in order to open the Jupyter server interface
- click the file "ShanChenPressureTensorIsotropy.ipynb"
- wait for all the extension to be loaded: when the notebook is loaded you should see a "Table of Contents" on the left side and the different code cells in the "folded" mode with a small grey arrow on the left

In order to excute the code content of a cell, select it and enter the key combination "shift + enter".
As of today, after much testing Google Chrome has offered the most reliable expreience in handling the notebook.

## Dependencies
A part from the python dependencies a working "latex" environment needs to be installed on the system in order to reproduce the plots which contain latex symbols

## Disk Requirements
The output of the fully executed notebook has a disk footprint of 143MB
