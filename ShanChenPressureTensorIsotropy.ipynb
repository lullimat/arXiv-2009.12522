    "**Abstract:**\n",
    " We systematically analyze the tensorial structure of the lattice pressure tensors for a class of multiphase lattice Boltzmann models (LBM) with multi-range interactions. Due to lattice discrete effects, we show that the built-in isotropy properties of the lattice interaction forces are not necessarily mirrored in the corresponding lattice pressure tensor. We therefore outline a new procedure to retrieve the desired isotropy in the lattice pressure tensors via a suitable choice of multi-range potentials. The newly obtained LBM forcing schemes are tested via numerical simulations of non-ideal equilibrium interfaces and are shown to yield weaker and less spatially extended spurious currents with respect to previous higher order forcing schemes obtained by forcing isotropy requirements only.\n",

Since there are some issues in executing these scripts in the Jupyter environment we include them as separated files which are called from the cells themselves. **In order to reproduce the plots a working 'latex' installation is necessary to be present on the system.**\n",
